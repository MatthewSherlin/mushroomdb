# Cypher Query Reference

mushroomdb supports a read-only Cypher subset for pattern matching, filtering,
aggregation, and ordering.  This page documents the full grammar, with a
dedicated section on variable-length paths and `shortestPath`.

---

## Basic patterns

```cypher
MATCH (n:Person)-[:KNOWS]->(m:Person)
WHERE n.name = 'Alice'
RETURN m.name
ORDER BY m.name
LIMIT 10
```

### Node patterns

```
(var:Label {key: 'value'})
```

- `var` — optional binding name
- `:Label` — optional label filter
- `{key: 'value'}` — zero or more property equality filters

### Relationship patterns

```
-[r:TYPE]->    right-directed
<-[r:TYPE]-    left-directed
-[r:TYPE]-     undirected (matches either direction)
```

The relationship variable (`r`) is optional.  Omitting the brackets entirely
(`-->`) is also accepted.

---

## Variable-length paths

Add `*min..max` inside the relationship brackets to match paths spanning
multiple hops:

```cypher
MATCH (a:N)-[r:T*1..5]->(b:N)
RETURN b
```

### Range syntax

| Syntax      | Meaning                           |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| `*`         | 1 to 10 hops (bare star default)  |
| `*n`        | Exactly n hops                    |
| `*min..max` | min to max hops (both inclusive)  |
| `*..max`    | 1 to max hops                     |

**Hard cap: max hops ≤ 10.**  Patterns with an unbounded upper end (`*min..`)
or with `max > 10` are rejected at parse time with the error:

```
variable-length paths are capped at 10 hops
```

**Minimum hop count ≥ 1.**  Zero-length paths (`*0`, `*0..N`) are not
supported and are rejected at parse time with the error:

```
zero-length variable-length paths are not supported; minimum hop count is 1
```

### Semantics

- **BFS expansion** — each hop expands all neighbours of the current frontier.
- **Per-path edge uniqueness** — a relationship may not appear twice within the
  same path (Cypher relationship isomorphism).  This guarantees termination on
  cyclic graphs.
- **Intermediate-row budget** — if the output row count reaches 1,000,000 the
  query is aborted with an error naming the limit.  Use tighter ranges or a
  `WHERE` filter to stay within budget on dense graphs.

### Executor routing

Variable-length plans always use the *staged* execution path regardless of a
`LIMIT` clause.  `LIMIT` is applied after materialisation.

### Accessing path length

The relationship variable bound in a `*min..max` pattern exposes a virtual
`.length` field:

```cypher
MATCH (a:N)-[r:T*1..5]->(b:N)
RETURN r.length
```

No other fields on `r` are available for variable-length relationships.

---

## shortestPath

`shortestPath` finds the shortest directed path between two **already-bound**
nodes:

```cypher
MATCH (a:N {id: 'alice'}), (b:N {id: 'bob'})
MATCH shortestPath((a)-[r:T*..5]->(b))
RETURN r.length
```

- Both endpoints must be bound before the `shortestPath` clause.  Unbound
  forms are rejected at planning time.
- A minimum hop count greater than 1 (e.g., `*2..5`) is rejected at planning
  time with the error `"shortestPath does not support a minimum hop count"`.
  Use a plain variable-length pattern if you need a minimum.
- BFS stops at the first path found (shortest hop count).
- **Tie behavior:** When two or more paths reach the destination at the same
  BFS depth, exactly one row is returned.  The choice is arbitrary (internal
  storage order) and is not guaranteed to be stable across re-opens or inserts.
- The `*..max` range cap still applies (max ≤ 10).
- Returns zero rows when no path exists within the hop limit.

## Aggregation

```cypher
MATCH (a:N)-[:T]->(b:N)
RETURN COUNT(*)

MATCH (a:N)-[r:RATED]->(b:N)
RETURN AVG(r.score)
```

Supported functions: `COUNT(*)`, `COUNT(var)`, `SUM(var.field)`,
`AVG(var.field)`, `MIN(var.field)`, `MAX(var.field)`.

Grouped aggregation (`RETURN a, COUNT(*)`) is not supported.

---

## ORDER BY / SKIP / LIMIT

```cypher
MATCH (n:Person)-[:KNOWS]->(m:Person)
RETURN m.name
ORDER BY m.name DESC
SKIP 10
LIMIT 5
```

---

## Limitations

| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| Write clauses (CREATE / SET / DELETE) | Not supported |
| Multi-statement transactions | Not supported |
| Grouped aggregation | Not supported |
| Variable-length paths: max hops | Capped at 10 |
| shortestPath with unbound endpoints | Rejected at planning time |
| Intermediate result budget | 1,000,000 rows |
